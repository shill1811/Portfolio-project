          <p class="dark">
            I am an emerging software developer, specializing in front-end web
            development, despite my background in medical laboratory science and
            my current role in that.

            My journey into the tech world commenced a year ago when I decided
            to lean HTML, CSS and JavaScrip on my own. Over the last three
            months, I've been actively honing my skills with the invaluable
            guidance and support from a group called ('Because She Can'
            Mentorship Program) and my dedicated mentor assinged to me by the
            BSC program. I've acquired a solid foundation and am enthusiastic
            about my ongoing learning and growth in the months and years to come
            and I'm excited to share my first self-made project, which is my
            portfolio website.

            While you explore my profile, I warmly welcome any opportunities,
            whether they involve internships or further training. I'm open to a
            wide range of possibilities and am excited to leave my mark on the
            tech industry. Keep an eye on my journey!
